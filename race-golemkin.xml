			<h4>Golemkin Nature</h4>
			<p>
			Golemkin are usually a bold, outgoing people with a strong sense of honor and justice. They are most populous in desert areas, enjoy warm climates, and their culture has strong emphasis on inheritance of land and wealth.</p>
			<p class="indent">Golemkin are somewhat unusual in terms of lifecycle in that they are born biological humanoids with flesh and blood, and at the onset of puberty they begin to turn into their Golemkin form. Their blood becoming a liquid mud and organs turning to clay. As their Golemkin traits become more apperent, they lose all their hair, and their eyes' pupils become cross shaped like those of a goat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">When Golemkin elders die there is typically an elaborate death ritual where they are heated, shattered, and the fragments distributed throughout the local Golemkin community. Most Golemkin choose to absorb these fragments into their own body so that the elder may live on as a part of them.</p>
			<h4>Golemkin Varieties</h4>
			<p>Skin tones are often similar to local clay deposits and vary widely depending on the earth tones of the area around them. A Golemkin's skin has even been known to gradually shift tones over long periods of time to match local earth colors.
			There are several common variations of Golemkin, primarily in the functions of their skin, and the functions of their inner core or heart. Softskins, Hardskins, Embercores, and Fluidcores.</p>
			<h4>Golemkin Traditions</h4>
			<p>All of the Golemkin people have an innate bond with the earth, finding it a natural comfort when in close contact with it. Mudbaths are popular, as is walking barefoot so that contact with the earth more frequent. They are an outgoing people who are comfortable with their nature, and easily adapt to other cultures and societies. As Golemkin approach the end of their natural lives, they feel a strong urge to return to the place of their origin.</p>
			<h4>Golemkin Politics</h4>
			<p>Each community of Golemkin is lead by a small council of elders. There is always an odd number of council members to minimise indecision. Being an amenable people, internal conflict is rare but when it does occur, it falls to the council to advise and pass judgement as needed.</p>
