			<h4>Dullahan Nature</h4>
			<p>
			Dullahan are usually a confident, calm people with a strong sense of honor and justice. They are most populous in swamp land and marsh land, and their culture has strong emphasis on justice and honor.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dullahan are somewhat unusual in terms of lifecycle in that they rise naturally from the land on a full moon as full-grown adults, and do not age. Their head is detachable, and if more than 10 feet away from their body or destroyed, it returns to the body fully restored. Damage to a Dullahan can be caused both to the head and body, but decapitation is a temporary inconvenience rather than a mortal wound.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">When Dullahan are slain, their soul remains within 5ft of their corpse for 1 hour before travelling to the beyond.</p>
			<h4>Dullahan Varieties</h4>
			<p>All varieties of Dullahan are tall, typically 7-8ft including their head, and have pale skin with deep blue veins showing through. They are sometimes confused with other Undead humanoids, but are distinctive in that their flesh is always in excellent condition (aside from being bloodless).
			There are several common variations of Dullahan, differing primarily in the manifestation of their spiritual abilities. Whip Masters, Blade Masters, Headless Masters, and Soul Masters.</p>
			<h4>Dullahan Traditions</h4>
			<p>All of the Dullahan people have an innate bond souls, finding it a easy to guide souls to the afterlife and communicate with them. They are also keep on cleanliness, ejoying communal bathing and skin care regimens. It is considered quite rude to ask a Dullahan to remove their head as a parlor trick. Dullahan are known for their respect toward death, their knowledge of death rituals and funeral rites, and are sometimes requested if a cleric or priest cannot be found locally.</p>
			<h4>Dullahan Politics</h4>
			<p>Each community of Dullahan is usually small and isolationist, but are tolerant of visitors and traders for a short time at least, prefering their solitude.</p>

			<p>You have the ability to occasionally sense the presence of souls. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect souls. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any souls within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover and that isn’t protected from divination magic. This sense doesn’t tell you anything about a soul's capabilities or identity, nor that of the soul's host.</p>

			<p>You sit cross-legged, holding your detached head in your hands, and create a spectral head within range that hovers in the air for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">You mentally receive visual information from the spectral head, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The spectral head can look in every direction.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can move the spectral head up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the spectral head can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the spectral head’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 foot in diameter.</p>
