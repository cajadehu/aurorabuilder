			<p>
			Cautious action and prudent planning make for success. Squirrelan are typically an anxious yet passionate people. Often found in the deepest parts of forests their culture has a strong emphasis on seasonal harvests, living off the land, and family life.</p>
			<p class="indent">
			Squirrelan tend to live out their entire lives within a few miles of their birthplace and have a strong bond with nature. They rarely travel far unless forced otherwise by the destruction of their habitat, or lack of natural resources. Occasionally a Squirrelan may seek a different life full of adventure and action, although few ever return to their homeland finding it too small and restrictive.
			<h4>Squirrelan Varieties</h4>
			There are several variations between sub-species, primarily in fur color with other differences being more subtle, and generally only noticed by those raised in Squirrelan society. The three most well known varieties are red, brown, and grey.</p>
			<h4>Squirrelan Traditions</h4>
			<p>All of the Squirrelan people have an innate bond with nature, particularly with trees. The gathering of preserves for storage over long and cold winters is commonplace, and the coming of spring is celebrated with a large communal festival. Young Squirrelans can often be seen leaping from tree branch to tree branch in competitive glee. Some have been known to shave down much of their tail fur in order to better hide it within their armor for protection, while others spend a great deal of time adorning their tail and fur with shinning bobbles and ribbons as a display of wealth or prominance to others.</p>
			<h4>Squirrelan Politics</h4>
			<p>Each community of Squirrelans is lead by a small council of elders. There is always an odd number of council members to minimise indecision. Being an amenable people, internal conflict is rare but when it does occur, it falls to the council to advise and pass judgement as needed.</p>
